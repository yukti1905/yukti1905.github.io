I am a third-year undergraduate student at the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi, where I am studying Biochemical Engineering and Computer Science. I am fortunate to have had the opportunity to work with [Prof. Ishaan Gupta](https://sites.google.com/view/fungel-iitd/home)  on some incredible research projects on the applications of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence to healthcare and COVID-19. I enjoy showcasing my work and will be sharing the details of my projects here. Feel free to contact me if you have something interesting in mind!
